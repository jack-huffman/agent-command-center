# Changelog

What changed in each release of Agent Command Center, newest first. The
extension, the plugin and acc share one version. Each release is a GitHub
Release of this repo, with the extension's `.vsix` attached and its entry here
as the notes.

## 0.35.0

- One version for everything: acc, the extension, the plugin and its
  marketplace entry all say 0.35.0. `acc --version` said 0.1.0 before.
- This changelog, and a package that won't build without an entry for its
  version.
- A package is checked for the packager's personal data before it's made: home
  folders, their git email, their GitHub accounts, their name in a `.claude` or
  `.acc` path, and the trackers they've signed in to. Anything found stops the
  package and is listed by file and line.
- The plugin's author and the marketplace's owner are now Agent Command Center,
  linking to this repo, rather than a person's GitHub account.
- Releases are on GitHub, made by a person with `npm run release`. Agents can't
  make one.
- More builders at once: a machine sets how many heavy checks (builds, tests,
  validations) run together with `acc machine heavy-slots`, two here, and this
  repo runs up to five builders, on Opus 5.5.
- Setup has a real step for the acc plugin in Claude Code: it checks the plugin
  is installed for every session and installs it from this repo. The README has
  an Install and first run section for someone new, and ONBOARDING.md matches
  the walkthrough.
- Setup no longer re-runs its checks each time a builder saves a file in its
  worktree, and saving a project's settings from the Command Center works again.

## 0.34.0

- A promotion drafts ticket updates for the tasks it carries, as a merge and a
  deploy do. A task two promotions took on arrives with the first to merge.
- A pull request whose GitHub checks fail goes back to its builder, once a
  commit, with the failing checks' report. Autopilot asks GitHub about checks
  once a commit, when they've settled.
- acc runs with no Node installed. A small launcher runs it with Node 20 or
  later when there is one, else with VSCode's own runtime. The plugin's hooks
  never break a session for want of Node.
- Notices can go to Slack: what needs you, finished reviews, pull requests
  autopilot opened, and draft updates waiting. They're off until you turn them
  on, sent once each, and in fixed words.
- Connecting a tracker says to sign in before its lists fill, and tracking a
  ticket from its card hands it to acc as before, now with a test.
