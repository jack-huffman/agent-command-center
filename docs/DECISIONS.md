# Decisions

Newest last. Each entry records what was decided and why, so later changes can
see what they are overturning.

## D-001 Build a thin layer over Claude Code, don't adopt an orchestrator (2026-10-01)

Claude Code already runs agents in isolated worktrees, keeps a registry of live
sessions, and exposes hooks. What is missing is one view in VSCode and intake
from issue trackers. Standalone tools either live outside VSCode, don't write
back to trackers, or bring a heavy stack. See
[research/2026-10-01-landscape.md](research/2026-10-01-landscape.md).

## D-002 No dependency on other skills (2026-10-01)

Everything the project needs ships inside its own plugin. It must work on a
machine with no other skills installed. Ideas from other skill sets are welcome,
but they are rewritten here, not called.

## D-003 Project-agnostic core with a Salesforce profile (2026-10-01)

Salesforce is the first and most important target, but it is one profile. The
ledger, dispatch, review and extension know nothing about Salesforce. The
`salesforce` profile adds deploy validation, static analysis and org-aware
checks.

## D-004 TypeScript for the CLI and the extension (2026-10-01)

One language lets the CLI and the extension share the ledger types and
validation. Node is already installed, and the stack matches the author's
earlier VSCode extension (TypeScript plus esbuild).

## D-005 GitHub Issues and Jira first; monday.com and Slack later (2026-10-01)

GitHub works through `gh` and Jira through the Atlassian connector today.
monday.com and Slack are deferred.

## D-006 Trackers are read, and only commented on (2026-10-01)

The tool reads tickets and posts the pull request link as a comment. It never
closes or transitions a ticket unless asked, because client trackers often
belong to the client.
