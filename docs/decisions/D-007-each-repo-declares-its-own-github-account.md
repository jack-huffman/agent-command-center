## D-007 Each repo declares its own GitHub account (2026-10-01)

This tool's own source lives under a personal account, while client work lives
in private repos under a work account. One machine handles both accounts at
once, so each managed repo's config names the GitHub account it uses.

- The tool sets that repo's local commit identity.
- It gives the repo a local credential helper that returns that account's token
  (`gh auth token -u <account>`).
- It passes `GH_TOKEN` on every `gh` call it makes for the repo.
- It never runs `gh auth switch`, because that changes the account for every
  session on the machine.

Background: `gh auth git-credential` ignores the requested username and returns
the active account's token. Without the helper, a repo would quietly push as
whichever account is active.
