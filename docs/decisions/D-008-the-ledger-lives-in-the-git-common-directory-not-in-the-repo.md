## D-008 The ledger lives in the git common directory, not in the repo (2026-10-01)

Task state goes in `<git-common-dir>/acc/`. The main checkout and every worktree
resolve to that same directory, and files there never show in a diff, never
conflict on merge, and are never pushed. The tracker stays the shared record for
teammates, and `acc sync` can rebuild the ledger from tracker, branches and
pull requests. The cost: one machine's view, not a shared one. That's fine
for v1.
