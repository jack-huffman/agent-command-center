## D-023 Row actions in tabs open VSCode's own context menu (2026-10-01)

Each row in the Agents and Worktrees tabs has one caret button instead of a row
of buttons. The caret, or a right-click anywhere on the row, opens VSCode's
native context menu.

**Why.** Four buttons per row crowded the table. A native menu looks like every
other VSCode menu, follows the theme, and works from the keyboard. It needs no
menu code of our own in the webview.

**How it works:**

- The row carries `data-vscode-context` with its section, its flags (such as
  `agentBackground`) and its `accRef`.
- `package.json` lists the items under `webview/context`, with when-clauses on
  those keys. Only items that apply are shown.
- Commands run from that menu receive the row context. `extension.ts` turns its
  `accRef` into the same node the sidebar passes, so one handler serves both.
- The caret dispatches a `contextmenu` event at its own position, which VSCode
  handles like a right-click.

**Table layout rules,** learned from the first two attempts:

- A grouped list is one table with a heading row per group, so the columns line
  up from group to group.
- Cells stay table cells. A test fails any rule that would make a cell flex.
- The actions column sticks to the right edge. A narrow tab drops the minor
  columns, then scrolls the table under the actions column instead of hiding it.

Board cards still carry their buttons inline. They can adopt this too.
