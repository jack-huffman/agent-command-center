## D-019 The GUI is a VSCode extension, and a thin one (2026-10-01)

The user asked whether this should be a VSCode extension. It should, because
they work in VSCode, and walkthroughs, terminals, notifications and panels are
all native there. It can also put `acc` on every terminal's PATH. A local web
dashboard, a standalone app or a plugin-only setup would each move the work
somewhere else or have no GUI.

The extension holds no logic of its own. It runs `acc … --json` in the
background, so everything stays tested in one place. It follows the
conventions of the author's SFDMU extension (publisher `JackHuffman`, esbuild,
theme icons and colours, modal confirms), without that extension's weak spots.
